# This script typically completes any required configuration of the package
# foo once foo has been unpacked from its Debian archive (".deb") file. Often,
# 'postinst' scripts ask the user for input, and/or warn the user that if he
# accepts default values, he should remember to go back and re-configure that
# package as the situation warrants. Many 'postinst' scripts then execute any
# commands necessary to start or restart a service once a new package has been
# installed or upgraded.
